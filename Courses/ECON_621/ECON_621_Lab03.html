<p>Each lab assignment needs to be submitted as the html output of an R Markdown file. At the top of each submission should be the title (eg, <em>ECON 621 - Lab #1</em>) and the student's name. File names should use the following structure: StudentLastName_ECON621_Lab_LabNumber. For example, <em>Gorski_ECON621_Lab_01</em>.</p>
<p>Assignments are due before the beginning of the following class.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the airports dataset from the course database with this query:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 80px;"><a id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1"></a>SELECT * FROM econ_621.airports</pre>
<p>1. Print the dimensions of <code>airports</code>.</p>
<p>2. What is the data class of of each of the columns ? Are there any that should or could be considered category variables? Why?</p>
<p>3. Write a script that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. Defines a vector of required columns as "name", "latitude", "longitude", and "avg_flights_per_day"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. Returns a T/F if <em>all</em> the columns are in <code>airports</code></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. Returns the name(s) of the missing column(s)</p>
<p>4. Change the name of the <code>timezone</code> column to <code>hrs_from_UTC</code>.</p>
<p>5. Which columns contain one or more <code>NA</code> values?</p>
<p>6. Are there <code>NA</code> values in the city column? Are there no missing values there? Set all missing values to <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p>7. Use the <code>summary</code> function to describe the altitude of airports in this dataset.</p>
<p>8. Which airport in China is at the highest altitude?</p>
<p>9. Find the average <code>hrs_from_UTC</code>: can you infer anything from this value about the general location of airports in this dataset?</p>
<p>10. Are there any airports that are missing both a IATA or ICAO airport code? Use the <code>table</code> function and T/F conditional statements to answer.</p>
<p>11. Which is the country with the most airports? What percentage of all airports in <code>airports</code> are in that country?</p>
<p>12. Are there cities with more than one airport?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. Before investigating, what do you expect to see as an answer?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b.&nbsp;Use the <code>duplicated</code> function to see whether there are any cities with more than one airport (hint: you'll need both the <code>city</code> and <code>country</code> columns).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. What is the name (city and country) of one of the cities with more than one airport?</p>
<p>13. Merging <code>airports</code> and GDP data</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. Import the most recent GDP data from the <code>natl_gdp</code> dataset in the course database, using this query:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 80px;"><a id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1"></a>SELECT country, "2017" as "gdp_2017"
FROM econ_621.natl_gdp
WHERE "2017" IS NOT NULL</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. Create a new dataset by merging <code>airports</code> with your GDP data. Ensure that your dataset only contains rows with a value for GDP and an airport ID. Print the dimensions of this new dataset.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. Create another new dataset, again by merging <code>airports</code> with your GDP data. This time, keep all data from either dataset.</p>
