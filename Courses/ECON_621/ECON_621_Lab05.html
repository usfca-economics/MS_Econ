<p>Each lab assignment needs to be submitted as the html output of an R Markdown file. At the top of each submission should be the title (eg, <em>ECON 621 - Lab #1</em>) and the student's name. File names should use the following structure: StudentLastName_ECON621_Lab_LabNumber. For example, <em>Gorski_ECON621_Lab_01</em>.</p>
<p>Assignments are due before the beginning of the following class.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the test scores and life expectancy datasets from the course database with these queries (you need to run each query separately):</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 80px;"><a id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1"></a>SELECT * FROM econ_621.test_scores;<br />SELECT * FROM econ_621.life_expectancy;</pre>
<p>You will also need the <code>rnaturalearth</code> dataset we used during lecture.</p>
<p>1. Use the data in the <code>test_scores</code> table to construct a bar graph examining how many students in each school have at least one test score from 2015. Use either <code>barplot</code> or <code>ggplot</code>. Modify your visual how you see fit to best communicate your results.</p>
<p>2. Again using the <code>test_scores</code> data, build a histogram to show the distribution of 3rd Grade SBAC ELA scores in 2015. Add the mean score to your visual. Use either <code>hist</code> or <code>ggplot</code>. Modify your visual how you see fit to best communicate your results.</p>
<p>3. From the <code>test_scores</code> data, create a scatterplot to show the relationship between the SBAC and NWEA MAP exams for 4th grade students in Math in 2015. Have the color of each student's point reflect the school they attend. Does it appear there is a relationship between the two tests? Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>ggplot</code></li>
<li>If a student has more than one MAP score, use the highest <code>testperiod</code> value</li>
<li>Consider transforming the data so that you have one row per student</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Use the <code>life_expectancy</code> table and the <code>rnaturalearth</code> data to create a map of Africa where each country is shaded to show its 2018 life expectancy. Hint: some names won't match (eg, "Congo, Dem. Rep." =/= "Democratic Republic of the Congo"), so you'll need to rectify.</p>
<p>5. Back to the <code>test_scores</code> data. Create a heat map to show how NWEA MAP percentiles relate to SBAC proficiency levels for 5th grade English/ELA in 2015. Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data structure you need to create is similar to #3.</li>
<li>The you can create bins for percentiles to treat the values like categories.</li>
</ul>
