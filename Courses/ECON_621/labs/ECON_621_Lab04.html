<p>Each lab assignment needs to be submitted as the html output of an R Markdown file. At the top of each submission should be the title (eg, <em>ECON 621 - Lab #1</em>) and the student's name. File names should use the following structure: StudentLastName_ECON621_Lab_LabNumber. For example, <em>Gorski_ECON621_Lab_01</em>.</p>
<p>Assignments are due before the beginning of the following class.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the population, gdppercapita, and life_expectancy datasets from the course database with these queries (you need to run each query separately):</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 80px;"><a id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1"></a>SELECT * FROM econ_621.population;<br />SELECT * FROM econ_621.gdppercapita;<br />SELECT * FROM econ_621.life_expectancy;</pre>
<p>These three data sets have data on population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy (some numbers clearly extrapolated) for nearly every country for every year from 1800 through the present. This data is designed to look at how individual countries have changed over time, relative to one another. But I'm interested in how&nbsp;<em>the whole world</em> has changed on these dimensions over time. I would like to know how the world average of GDP per capita and life expectancy have changed between 1800 and now.</p>
<p>To do this, I want to take a weighted average (by population) of GDP per capita and of life expectancy for every year in these datasets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For example, imagine only two countries and one year:</p>
<table style="height: 85px; width: 54.8065%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%;"><strong>Country</strong></td>
<td style="width: 20%;"><strong>Year</strong></td>
<td style="width: 20%;"><strong>Population</strong></td>
<td style="width: 20%;"><strong>GDP</strong></td>
<td style="width: 20%;"><strong>LE</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%;">China</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">1900</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">85</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">20</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%;">India</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">1900</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">70</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">25</td>
<td style="width: 20%;">35</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The weighted average of GDP would be: ((85/(85 + 70)) * 20) + ((70/(85 + 70))* 25),&nbsp; and of LE: ((85/(85 + 70)) * 32) + ((70/(85 + 70)) * 35)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The output for this example would be one row:</p>
<table style="height: 55px; width: 30.8452%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;"><strong>Year</strong></td>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;"><strong>GDP</strong></td>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;"><strong>LE</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;">1900</td>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;">22.25</td>
<td style="width: 33.3333%;">33.35</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Your output should have the same column structure, and should have one row for every year that exists <em>in all three datasets</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some hints/suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the calculation that you need to perform and the data that you need to execute.
<ul>
<li>For example, you will need the % of the total population for each country for each year (eg, Bangladesh, 1800, 0.02). If you have a numeric vector, and you want to know what proportion of the sum of that vector each value contains, <code>vec/sum(vec)</code> will give you a vector of those proportions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It will be helpful to think about data transformations such as casting, merging, and creating new data with the <code>ldply(lapply(split(x)))</code> technique.</li>
<li>Double check your processes by doing the calculations long form for one country, one year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Print your resulting table in your assignment. It will be long, but that's okay.</p>
