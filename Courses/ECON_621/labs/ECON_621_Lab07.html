<p>Each lab assignment needs to be submitted as the html output of an R Markdown file. At the top of each submission should be the title (eg, <em>ECON 621 - Lab #1</em>) and the student's name. File names should use the following structure: StudentLastName_ECON621_Lab_LabNumber. For example, <em>Gorski_ECON621_Lab_01</em>.</p>
<p>Assignments are due before the beginning of the following class.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the aid received, population, and life expectancy datasets from the course database with these queries (you need to run each query separately):</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 80px;"><a id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1"></a>SELECT * FROM econ_621.aid_received;<br />SELECT * FROM econ_621.population;<br />SELECT * FROM econ_621.life_expectancy;</pre>
<p>1. Use the aid received data to test the claim that: "on average aid has stayed the between 2000 and 2010." Randomly select 30 countries to get your sample. (Hint: use the <code>sample</code> function.) What type of test do you use and why? Run your test and interpret the p-value. Can you reject the claim or not?</p>
<p>2. Now suppose the claim was, "on average, aid <em>has not increased</em> between 2000 and 2010." What type of test do you use and why? Resample your data, run your test, and interpret the p-value. Can you reject the claim or not?</p>
<p>3. Add the population data your data to calculate per capita aid received. Test the claim that per capita aid received is the same in Africa as in Latin America in 2015. (Hint: create a <code>continent</code> category variable.) What type of test do you use and why? Run your test and interpret the p-value. Can you reject the claim or not?</p>
<p>4. Continue with the same data to examine whether aid per capita varied by continent in 2015. Consider all continents.</p>
<p>5. Add the life expectancy data to your data to see if there is a correlation between life expectancy and aid per capita. Run a test to calculate whether this correlation is statistically significant or not. Given the correlation you find, can you conclude that increased aid received causes increased life expectancy? Why or why not? What else could be going on?</p>
